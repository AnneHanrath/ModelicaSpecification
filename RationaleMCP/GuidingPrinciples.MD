Guiding Principles of the Modelica Language Development
--

The overall goal of the development process is guided by the following fundamental tenets that all aim to 
facilitate widespread adoption of the standard and promoting modeling of cyber-physical systems: 

1. Compatibility: The Modelica Language Standard shall be internally consistent and complete. 
The Standard documents shall be an enabler for convenient and precise definition of cyber-physical systems. 

2. Simplicity: The Modelica Language Standard shall stay as simple as possible. 

3. Stability: Backwards compatibility of future versions of the Modelica Language Standard shall be maintained whenever possible. 

4. Neutrality: The Modelica Language shall be neutral with respect to tools, technologies (e.g. processors, compilers, OS, 
file system access, solvers, real-time capability, ...) and languages. 

5. Transparency: End users and tool vendors shall be informed about the progress of standardization as early as possible.
