# Rationale
Sketch of the proposal (especially with examples) and an explanation of the business case: Why should this feature be included? What problems can be solved (better) that cannot be solved (as easily) now? 
Provide at minimum two use cases for your proposal that show how it is applied. For each use case state how it could be implemented by current Modelica at best and why the current Modelica does not suffice for this application. 
Proposed Changes in Specification

The precise updated text of the specification is part of this branch/pull-request.

# Backwards Compatibility
It has to be analyzed whether the proposal is backwards compatibile. If any possible, this should be the case. Even if it is backwards compatible, issues should be listed and analyzed that may cause problems. 

List (preferably existing) examples that would be corrupted by proposed changes in specification. 

Show what can be done about these cases. Provide a concept for a conversion script or any other solution. 

# Tool Implementation

## Experience with Prototype
The prototype implementation has to be sketched and the experience gained with the prototype, especially the implementation effort. Furthermore, simple test cases have to be provided to profoundly illustrate the solution of the problem, and at least one description of an industry-size example to prove scalability of the solution. 

# Required Patents
At best of your knowledge state any patents that would be required for implementation of this proposal.
